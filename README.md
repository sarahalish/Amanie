🕋 Amani Project (مشروع أماني)
An AI-Powered Proactive System for Pilgrims' Health & Safety

🌟 Overview
Amani is a sophisticated technical solution designed to ensure a safe health journey for Hajj and Umrah pilgrims. By leveraging Predictive AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system provides real-time, 100% reliable health guidance based on the official 1446H (2025) requirements from the Saudi Ministry of Health.

🚀 Key Features

Proactive Health Screening: Automatically checks for physical eligibility and flags conditions that prevent Hajj performance, such as advanced kidney, heart, or lung failure.


Vaccination Management: Tracks mandatory requirements for Meningococcal, COVID-19, and Polio vaccines, including specific validity periods (3 to 5 years depending on vaccine type).



Anti-Rumor Protocol: Uses a strict RAG chain to debunk health myths by retrieving only official, verified data from the MOH knowledge base.


Preventive Alerts: Provides real-time guidance on avoiding heat exhaustion and respiratory infections in crowded areas.



Emergency Interoperability: Includes NFC-ready medical profiles for instant paramedic access during critical events.

🛠 Technical Architecture
LLM Engine: Integrated via LangChain (Optimized for Arabic/English).

RAG Implementation: Atomic chunking of health protocols to ensure high-precision retrieval.


Data Sources: Based on the "Health Requirements for Travelers to Saudi Arabia for Hajj 1446H".

Safety Guardrails: Zero-temperature settings to prevent AI hallucinations.

📋 Core Knowledge Base (1446H Standards)
The system is fed with granular data extracted from official documents, including:


Exclusion Criteria: Prohibited cases such as advanced cirrhosis, severe neuropsychiatric diseases, and high-risk pregnancies.





Vaccine Protocols: Detailed rules for the ACYW135 meningococcal vaccine and updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 doses.


Environmental Safety: Guidance on food safety, hydration, and mosquito-borne disease prevention (Zika/Dengue).
